//**Toll calculation main class: Write aprogram that calculates the toll amount for travel along a toll road or toll lane. 
//The toll amount is based on the time of day, day of the week, and number of persons in the vehicle.
//The program gets the time of travel from the user using 24 hours formatas a string, then extracts the hour to determine the toll amount.
//You will need indexOfand substringmethods.You will also need to use Integer.parseInt(inputString)method to convert a string to integer.
//The program also asks for type of day from the user (0 for weekdays, and 1 for weekends or holidays).
//Since a toll road may have a discount for carpools, sometimes called high-occupancy vehicles (HOV). 
//The program asks for the number of people in the vehicleto adjust the toll amount based on this information. 
//The carpool discount rules are: •A carpool is 3 or more person per vehicle.  •The toll for carpools on weekdays between 6:00 am and 10:00 am is half the normal toll.  •Otherwise, the toll for carpools is 0 (as in free).Use if-else, nested if-else and multi-branch if-else statement as needed to determine the tollAmount based on the tables and user information.//
